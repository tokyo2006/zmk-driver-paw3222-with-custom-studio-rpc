# PAW3222 Module - Web Frontend

This is a web application (sensor configurator + frame viewer) for the
PAW3222 ZMK module's custom Studio RPC subsystem.

## Features

- **Device Connection**: Connect to ZMK devices via Serial (WebSerial)
- **Sensor info & diagnostics**: `GetInfo` (ready/product id/revision/init
  error/runtime config) and `ReadDiagnostics` (SQUAL/shutter/pixel min-avg-max),
  with optional 1s auto-refresh for diagnostics
- **Settings panel**: generic editor for the sensor's own custom settings
  (subsystem `xinta__paw3222`), talking to the separate
  `cormoran_custom_settings` subsystem provided by
  [zmk-feature-custom-settings](https://github.com/xinta/zmk-feature-custom-settings)
  (list/edit/write with memory or persist mode, save/discard/reset)
- **Frame viewer**: capture a still image from the sensor using the official
  PAW3222 datasheet `Pixel_Grab` procedure, and render it to a `<canvas>`.
  A capture-once button pulls one frame via `CaptureFrame` + chunked
  `GetFrameChunk`; a streaming toggle instead calls `SetFrameStream` and
  subscribes to `FrameStreamChunk` custom Studio notifications pushed by the
  firmware (no client-side polling loop) -- see "Frame viewer notes" below.
  Also shows an FPS counter, an invalid-byte (PG_VALID clear) warning count,
  and an advanced panel for the per-pixel retry budget.
- **Studio lock awareness**: the `xinta__paw3222` subsystem is secured
  (see the module README's "Security" section) -- the UI shows a banner and
  disables settings/frame controls while ZMK Studio is locked, and reacts to
  `UNLOCK_REQUIRED` RPC errors even if no lock notification was seen yet.
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern web development with Vite for fast builds
- **react-zmk-studio**: Uses the `@cormoran/zmk-studio-react-hook` library for
  simplified ZMK integration

## How It Works

### 1. Protocol Definition

This module's own protobuf schema is defined in
`../proto/xinta/paw3222/paw3222.proto`. The settings panel additionally
talks to zmk-feature-custom-settings' generic custom-settings subsystem,
whose schema (`xinta/zmk/custom_settings/custom_settings.proto`) lives in
that dependency's own repo, not this one.

### 2. Code Generation

TypeScript types are generated using `ts-proto`:

```bash
npm run generate
```

This runs `buf generate`, which uses the configuration in `buf.gen.yaml`.
`buf.gen.yaml` lists **two** input directories: this repo's own `../proto`,
and the west dependency checkout at
`../dependencies/zmk-feature-custom-settings/proto` (generated straight from
there, not vendored into this repo's `proto/` tree -- vendoring it there
would make this module's own firmware-side nanopb glob
(`CMakeLists.txt: proto/*.proto`) pick it up too and generate a second,
conflicting copy of the `cormoran.zmk.custom_settings` package, which would
fail to link into the `paw3222_settings_rpc` test artifact that includes
both modules).

### 3. Using react-zmk-studio

The app uses the `@cormoran/zmk-studio-react-hook` library:

```typescript
import { useZMKApp, ZMKCustomSubsystem } from "@cormoran/zmk-studio-react-hook";

// Connect to device
const { state, connect, findSubsystem, isConnected } = useZMKApp();

// Find the PAW3222 subsystem
const subsystem = findSubsystem("xinta__paw3222");

// Create service and make RPC calls
const service = new ZMKCustomSubsystem(state.connection, subsystem.index);
const response = await service.callRPC(payload);
```

The settings panel does the same thing but against a different subsystem:
`findSubsystem("cormoran_custom_settings")` (zmk-feature-custom-settings'
generic settings RPC), using `SettingRef.customSubsystemIndex` to point at
this module's `findSubsystem("xinta__paw3222")` result for `list_settings`
/ `write_setting` scopes.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

Use the test helpers from `@cormoran/zmk-studio-react-hook/testing`:

```typescript
import {
  createConnectedMockZMKApp,
  ZMKAppProvider,
} from "@cormoran/zmk-studio-react-hook/testing";

const mockZMKApp = createConnectedMockZMKApp({
  deviceName: "Test Device",
  subsystems: ["xinta__paw3222"],
});

render(
  <ZMKAppProvider value={mockZMKApp}>
    <YourComponent />
  </ZMKAppProvider>
);
```

## Frame viewer notes

- The firmware side has a fixed-size static frame buffer
  (`CONFIG_ZMK_PAW3222_STUDIO_RPC_FRAME_BUF_SIZE`, default 484 = 22x22).
  `CaptureFrame`/`SetFrameStream`'s `pixel_count` is clamped to this size.
- **Capture once** (`CaptureFrame` + `GetFrameChunk`): a one-shot pull --
  `CaptureFrame` captures into the firmware's static buffer, then the web
  app loops `GetFrameChunk` calls (see `chunkOffsets()`/`assembleFrame()` in
  `src/frame.ts`) up to 128 bytes at a time until the whole frame is
  collected. Rejects with an error if streaming is currently active (stop
  streaming first).
- **Streaming** (`SetFrameStream` + `FrameStreamChunk` notifications,
  Phase E): toggling "Start Streaming" calls `SetFrameStream{enable: true,
device_index, pixel_count, max_invalid_retries}`, then the firmware
  repeatedly captures frames on its own (system workqueue loop) and pushes
  one `FrameStreamChunk` custom Studio notification per 128-byte chunk of
  each frame -- the web app no longer drives a client-side capture loop.
  `createFrameAssembler()` in `src/frame.ts` incrementally reassembles
  chunks (by `frame_id`/`offset`) into a full frame and reports when it's
  complete so the canvas renders once per frame, not per chunk.
  "Stop Streaming" calls `SetFrameStream{enable: false, ...}` and
  unsubscribes. `CaptureFrame` and `SetFrameStream` share the same
  firmware-side buffer/frame_id, so the UI disables "Capture Once" while
  streaming is on.
- Frame rate depends on the sensor's wiring (`disable-burst-read`, see the
  module README's "Wiring" section): the default 4-wire burst path resets
  the sensor only once per streaming session and reads a whole frame in one
  SPI transaction, so it is sensor-limited rather than reset-limited -- much
  faster than earlier per-pixel-only builds. The 3-wire fallback still
  captures one 484-pixel frame via the `Pixel_Grab` procedure in roughly 2
  seconds (measured on real hardware), so expect on the order of 0.4-0.5 fps
  there -- not a bug, a correctness fallback for wiring that can't do a real
  burst read, not a performance target. The FPS counter reflects whichever
  path is actually wired up.
- If ZMK Studio locks while a stream is active, the firmware stops the loop
  on its own (see the module README's "Security" section) but cannot notify
  the client that it did so (notifications aren't request/response) -- the
  web app detects this via the lock-state banner/notification and resets
  its own "streaming" UI state to match once locked.
- Each `CaptureFrameResponse`/`FrameStreamChunk` carries a `format` field
  (`PixelFormat`) discriminating the pixel byte layout: `PIXEL_FORMAT_RAW8`
  (4-wire burst path) is a full 8-bit pixel with no validity bit;
  `PIXEL_FORMAT_PG7` (3-wire fallback, and the default for older firmware
  that predates this field) has bit7 as `PG_VALID` with bits[6:0] the pixel
  value. `src/frame.ts`'s `isValidPixelByte`/`pixelByteToGray`/`frameToRgba`
  all take `format` as an (optional, defaulting to PG7) parameter and
  `FrameViewer.tsx` threads the response/notification's `format` through to
  them -- PG7 masks bit7 for display (`(byte & 0x7f) << 1` for 8-bit
  grayscale) and counts bit7-clear bytes as a data-quality warning; RAW8
  renders every byte as-is and always reports 0 invalid bytes (the burst
  read is all-or-nothing -- see `complete`).

## Roadmap

This UI is feature-complete through Phase E (sensor info/diagnostics,
settings, frame capture/streaming, Studio lock awareness). The frame-capture
procedure has been hardware-validated (Phase D); Phase E's notification-based
streaming path has likewise been hardware-validated (see the module
README's "Frame capture" / "Security" sections and DESIGN.md).
