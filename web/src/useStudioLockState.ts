/**
 * Tracks ZMK Studio's core lock state for the connected device.

 * The `cormoran__paw3222` subsystem is secured (Phase E): every RPC call
 * against it (and the settings subsystem) fails with an `UNLOCK_REQUIRED`
 * meta error while Studio is locked. This hook subscribes to core lock
 * notifications (`onNotification({type: "core", ...})`) so the UI can show
 * a banner and disable controls proactively, without waiting for a call to
 * fail first.
 *
 * There is no RPC to *query* the initial lock state upfront in this
 * react-hook's current API (`zmk.core.Request` only has getDeviceInfo /
 * getLockState / lock / resetSettings, and getLockState is not currently
 * plumbed by useZMKApp()) -- so the initial state defaults to "unknown"
 * (treated as unlocked/optimistic) until either a lock notification arrives
 * or an RPC call fails with UNLOCK_REQUIRED (see `isUnlockRequiredError`
 * below, used by callers to react to that case too).
